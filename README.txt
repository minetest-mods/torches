About this mod:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This mod changes the default torch drawtype from "torchlike" to "mesh",
giving the torch a three dimensional appearance. The mesh contains the
proper pixel mapping to make the animation appear as a particle above
the torch, while in fact the animation is just the texture of the mesh.

Originally, this mod created in-game alternatives with several
draw styles.  The alternatives have been removed and instead of
providing alternate nodes, this mod now directly modifies the existing
nodes. Conversion from the wallmounted style is done through an LBM.
